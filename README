# speedLogger

This is a simple Python script for testing your internet link and graphing
the results. It was written to help diagnose peak-time congestion issues,
which are very obvious when logging is done over the course of several days.

This script was written to run under Linux, but should run under Cygwin on
Windows or any Unix-like environment without huge changes.

speedtest-cli is from https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli

Original speedLogger code is by GeorgeEdwards on the whirlpool.net.au forums.
