Step 1. Copy speedLogger.conf.example to speedLogger.conf and edit it.

# The path where you'll be running the script. Include the trailing slash.
scriptpath = /home/user/speedLogger/

# The server you want to upload your SVG graph to, if any.
destserver = username@server.example.org:/srv/www/htdocs/speedScript_output.svg

# Set uploadtoserver = 0 if you don't want to send the graph anywhere.
uploadtoserver = 1

# Name or IP of the host you want to use for the packet loss test.
# Your ISP would probably work best.
pingtarget = server.example.org

# Log to the console? If this is 0, silently produse the output.svg file.
verboselogging = 1


Step 2. Edit plot.gp.

The Y axis needs to be set to the speed of your net link.

Find the following line and replace the 30 with your link's top speed,
plus a bit to keep the legend out of the way:

set yrange [0:30]

In the plot area, you will need to find instances of "11*60*60" and
replace the "11" with your timezone's GMT offset.


Step 3. Schedule the speedLogger.py script to run as often as you like.

Remember that speed testing means flooding your internet link with data
for a while. This can slow down anything else running on the link, and
it can also blow out your monthly data quota.
